**Privacy Policy**

BlueMilk Apps built the CamPanes app with privacy in mind.  Other than the camera names, which are stored in the built-in local iOS keychain for convenience, the app doesn't create or store any other data, locally or in a cloud or other remote location.  The app solely interacts with Homekit software provided by Apple within the iOS operating system.
